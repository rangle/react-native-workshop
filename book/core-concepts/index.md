React Native communicates with the native UI components through a bridge. It exposes the native layer to JavaScript as both React components and APIs.

On the other hand it also provides polyfills for certain APIs that we have available on the web. This makes it easier for web developers to transition over to the React Native platform using technologies they know and love.
